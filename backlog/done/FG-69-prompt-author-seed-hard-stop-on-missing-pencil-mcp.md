title: "Prompt-author seed: hard-stop on missing Pencil MCP"
---

**Closed:** 2026-05-08, on `main` (seed change).
`seeds/agents/prompt-author/templates/ui-design.md` gains a PRECONDITION 0 step: verify `mcp__pencil__*` tools are connected before starting; if not, refuse to proceed and tell the human to reconnect. Caught 2026-05-08: a session ran the prompt without Pencil MCP attached and started writing HTML files as a fallback — wrong artifact type, would have hard-errored at `forge submit` because no .pen + no PNGs. Refuse + wait is the right shape, not improvise. Re-installed via `FORCE=1 scripts/install-seeds.sh`.
