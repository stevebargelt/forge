title: Interactive dashboard v1 (gate buttons, run-next, design review)
---

**Closed:** 2026-05-08, merged to main as `a8e1b0f` (merge of branch `interactive-dashboard-57`, branch commit `65eaae3`).
**What shipped:**
- Full reskin to the Lunaris designs at `~/code/forge-design/designs/01-08`. Three-pane layout. CSS variables sourced from the .pen file's variable block. Geist + Geist Mono via Google Fonts CDN.
- POST endpoints in `src/dashboard/server.ts` for `/api/gate/<task>`, `/api/next/<run>`, `/api/runs` (501 stub). All shell out to `bin/forge` per FORGE-DEC-015.
- Mutations gated behind `FORGE_DASHBOARD_INTERACTIVE=1` (read-only by default). CSRF = `X-Forge-Request: 1` header. Localhost-only.
- `GET /api/meta` reports the interactivity flag so the client renders gate buttons or copy-CLI fallbacks.
- `listRunsForDashboard` returns task counts via SQL JOIN.
- 11 new server tests on the branch.
**Screens shipped:** 01 run list, 02 task list, 03 generic detail, 04 design detail, 05 awaiting-gate, 06 run-row overflow, 08 blocked-by-red. Stub for 07 (new-run modal).
**Deferred to followups:** screens 09/10 (#54), 11 (#53), 12-20 (the 9 FOLLOWUP-PROMPT.md gaps). Dashboard polish #62-65. Real new-run modal pending `forge new` POST schema.
**Absorbs:** #34 (human-readable result view — partly), #35 (gate buttons + run-next), #48 (design review surface).
