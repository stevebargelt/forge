title: Elapsed-time cells tick once per second (smart-refresh side-effect)
---

**Closed:** 2026-05-09 overnight, on branch `phase-flow-71` (231 tests passing — pure UI, no test deltas).
- `src/dashboard/html.ts`: new `liveDurationSpan(extraClass, startIso, endIso)` helper that emits a `<span>` carrying `data-elapsed-started-at` + (when set) `data-elapsed-completed-at` attributes. New `tickElapsedCells` walks `[data-elapsed-started-at]` once per second and rewrites `textContent` only when `completedAt` is missing — no DOM identity churn, no scroll/focus/input disruption, smart-refresh keys (#72) untouched.
- New `startElapsedTicker` kicks off a single `setInterval(tickElapsedCells, 1000)` from `bootstrap`. Idempotent — second call is a no-op.
- Three call sites converted: run-pane DURATION (run-meta-strip), task-row trailing elapsed cell (row-side), and the task-detail ELAPSED row in `taskHeaderSection`. All three update live without polling.
- Pattern is reusable for any future once-per-second cell (countdowns, freshness indicators).
